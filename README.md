# csharp 
This code was created by Luis Munoz , according to the timestamp of the files in 2005. I thought it did this more recently...
If the datetime of the files are correct then i did this when i was doing Cobol procedural for living in a bank in Lima-Peru. 
and playing with C# compiler at night. 
In any case , this code attempt to detect bugs of any dll created in C#.net using a blackbox - edge parameters testing. 
It is a draft version and probably i should look at it again at some time to make something more functional.
